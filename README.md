# featureSelection-SSNR
Stepwise Non-linear Regression based on Support Vector Machine

## svmSNR.m
Main function to perform feature selection using SSNR. <br>
usage: [inpool_ind, outpool_ind, cv_mse0] = svmSNR(train, 5, ' -s 3 -t 2 ', 1, 'libsvm');

## CV_libsvm.m
A function to optimize the super-parameters using cross-validation in libsvm.

## CV_liblinear.m
A function to optimize the super-parameters using cross-validation in liblinear. <br>
'liblinear' is an alternative SVM for data set with large sample size and high dimensional features.

## svm_train.mex**
A mex file in the libsvm toolbox, which is used to train a svm model or do cross-validation in svm.

## liblinear_train.mex**
A mex file in the liblinear toolbox, which is used to train a liblinear model or do cross-validation in liblinear.

## svm_scale_easy.m
A function to scale training set and test set in a similar way. <br>
Because kernel values usually depend on the inner products of feature vectors, e.g. the linear kernel and the polynomial kernel, large attribute values might cause numerical problems. We recommend linearly scaling each attribute to the range [âˆ’1, +1] or [0, 1]. <br>
